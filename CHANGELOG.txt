v1.1:

* Fixed not getting the Spawn Setter when moving

v1.2:

+ Found out PowerInvulnerable lets you rocket jump normally, so I gave a version
  of that to the Rocket Jumper that lasts forever - ie. no damage flash :D

| BIG PERIOD OF NO CHANGELOG FUCKING HELL |

v4:
* Seperated Instant Rocket Launcher into I-Rocket Jumper
* No longer are you vulnerable again on map change
* Super Railgun no longer usable for rocket jumping
* Moved around slot numbers (Spawn-Setter 1, Rocket Launchers 3, offense weapons
  6)
* Added +UNDROPPABLE to all weapons (actually, made them inherit from RJWeapon,
  which has +UNDROPPABLE, but shut up)

v4.1:
+ Added Spawn Item (the blursphere)
+ Added Pickup Toggler (the prosperity)
+ Added Smart Switch Toggler (the smaller blursphere)
* Spawn Setter changed to two items (the invuln spheres - small one unsets)
* No longer do you become vulnerable on death (apparently having invincibility
  on death neuters the effect)
* Now your rocket launcher is the weapon that's out when you join
* First Super Chaingun bullet is perfectly accurate with primary fire
* Super Chaingun bullets now do random(40, 60) base damage
* Spawn Setter now records pitch
* Smart toggling between the Spawn Item and Spawn Setter - when you leave
  ground, you switch to Spawn Item, and when you land, you switch to Spawn
  Setter - this can be toggled by the Smart Switch Toggler
